Bien sûr 🙂
Voici **la version anglaise**, fidèle au fond et au ton, naturelle pour un public tech anglophone :

### Lazy developers? No. But sometimes over-assisted.

Developers are often described as lazy.
That’s simply not true.

Developers dislike repetition because they **enjoy understanding**, **optimizing**, and **automating** things. Automation is not about avoiding work — it’s about elegance. It’s one of the core motivations of the profession.

But like any good trait, it can be **pushed too far**.

With some ecosystems — .NET is often mentioned — abstraction is taken to such an extreme that developers no longer need to understand what is really happening. Things work, the magic happens… until one day performance drops, memory leaks appear, or the system becomes impossible to reason about.

The problem is not the tool.
The problem is **losing touch with the core of the craft**.

### The cooking analogy 🍝

Take a traditional Italian restaurant.

* They make their own pasta.
* They know the ingredients.
* They understand timing, texture, and reactions.

That’s not laziness — that’s **passion** and **mastery**.

Now, using a machine to knead the dough?
Perfectly fine.
You optimize the process without giving up the recipe.

But buying industrial, pre-made pasta and just adding a sauce?
At that point, you’re no longer cooking — you’re assembling.

---

### Applied to software development

* Low-level programming, understanding memory, execution, and real costs → **making the dough**
* Using tools, frameworks, and libraries → **the kitchen machine**
* Relying entirely on heavy, opaque abstractions → **industrial pasta**

A framework is not the problem.
Not knowing **what it replaces** is.

When a developer no longer understands what their code actually does:

* in terms of performance,
* security,
* memory usage,
* or complexity,

they become dependent on the platform instead of mastering it.

---

### Conclusion

A good developer is not someone who refuses modern tools.
A good developer is someone who **could work without them**, because they understand the fundamentals.

> A developer should know how to make the dough by hand —
> even if they choose to use a machine afterward.

That technical culture and level of care is what separates *building fast* from *building well*.

Si tu veux, je peux aussi te faire :

* une version **plus courte / punchy** pour Hacker News,
* une version **plus technique** (VMs, abstractions, hidden costs),
* ou une version **plus provocatrice** 😉
